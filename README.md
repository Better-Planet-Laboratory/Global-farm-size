The aim of this document is to create a global map of farm sizes. We do this by merging two currently available sources of information on the distribution of farm sizes across the world: national level data on farm size distributions and subnational data on field size distributions. The resulting map is a dataset of where different sizes of farms are distributed globally. As with the geospatial products on which the map is derived, we caution that this map should not be used for detailed within country-level analysis, but is intended for global assessment studies, where results are typically aggregated at the regional or global level. This document explains the underlying data, pre-processing, and algorithm we developed to create this map. We were driven to create this map as a work that can be built upon and improved as higher resolution and more accurate data become available.


This dataset was originally created for the peer-reviewed publication:
